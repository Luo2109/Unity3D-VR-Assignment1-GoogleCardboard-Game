**Prototype Development Overview**:
For this assignment, I developed a basic prototype for a VR app that allows users to explore a simulated environment based on the shooting style gaming experiences. The prototype is inspired by the famous current VR shooting game Pavlov, so it is basically a first person shooting game, with shooting range, CQB combat training area integrated. The goal was to provide an immersive and interactive VR first person shooting training environment, integrating 360-degree visuals and a very simple navigation system.

**Design Process**:
1.Initial Conceptualization: At this stage, I have identified key features of this app, such as user navigation, visual interactivity, environment presentation and specific features to be included.
2.Environment Creation: First, I designed a simple Rube Goldberg Machine to present the ability of the Unity 3D engine. Then, surrounded 3D walls were created to representing the CQB training venues, utilizing a combination of Unity 3D and 360-degree imagery.
3.User Interface (UI) and Features: The UI was kept minimal. The features of this application including the basic for shooting, color changing, objects rotating and interaction with the objects.
4.Testing and Implementation: After developing the basic interactions, the prototype was tested for multiple times on both Android and Unity to ensure compatibility and usability.
